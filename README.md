# THE ONE WITH THE FAVORITE SERIES
### Released on September 22 of 1994, spanned 10 seasons with a total of 236 episodes. This series revolved around six friends living in New York City. This series explored the themes of friendship, love, career struggles, and life's ups and downs which made me fall inlove with the series more. I often binge watch every single episode of the series for its relatable issues, back then this series felt weird but the more I grow, the more I struggle, this series made sense to me as its characters were witty, humurous, and their heartwarming appearance during the series.
